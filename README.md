# DeepStockPredict

## Overview

DeepStockPredict is a project focused on utilizing deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for stock market prediction. This project is tailored for predicting stock prices using historical Apple stock data. The LSTM model is employed to capture intricate patterns and dependencies in the time series data, facilitating more accurate predictions of future stock prices.

## Features

- **LSTM Model**: Utilizes a deep learning LSTM architecture for time series prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline to handle missing values, scale data, and engineer features.
- **Sequence Generation**: Creates sequences of historical data suitable for training the LSTM model.
- **Training and Validation**: Trains the LSTM model on historical data with validation for model evaluation.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Provides visualizations to compare predicted and actual stock prices.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with DeepStockPredict:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/TejParmar10/stock_market_prediction.git`

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Data Preparation**: Ensure you have the Apple stock dataset (e.g., `apple_stock_data.csv`) in the project directory.

4. **Run the Application**: Execute the `stock_prediction_apple.py` script to train the LSTM model and make predictions.

```bash
python stock_prediction_apple.py
```

## File Structure

- `stock_prediction_apple.py`: Main script for loading, preprocessing, training, and predicting using the LSTM model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for the project.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the hyperparameters, model architecture, or any other aspect of the project to suit your needs. Experiment with different LSTM configurations for optimal performance.

## Results

The project aims to provide accurate stock price predictions, and the results can be visualized through plots generated during the prediction phase.
